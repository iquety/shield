## Synopsis

```bash
composer require iquety/shield
```

This is a library offering a set of Assertions for values and expressions.

In computing, assertion is a check with the aim of certifying that a certain 
condition imposed by the developer is true.

The use of assertions is very useful, especially when validating values coming 
from method arguments or user input.

## How to use

Assertions are registered through the `Shield` library.

Can be used in the conventional way:

```php

$name = 'Ricardo';

$instance = new Shield();

// Does 'Ricardo' 4 characters or less?
$instance->assert(new MaxLength($name, 4)); 

// or all assertions match,
// or an exception is thrown
$instance->validOrThrow();
```

or in fluent form:

```php

$name = 'Ricardo';

$instance = (new Shield())
    ->assert(new MaxLength($name, 4))
    ->validOrThrow();
```

In the example above, an exception of type `Exception` will be thrown with the 
message *"The value was not successfully asserted"*.

For detailed information, see [Documentation Summary](docs/en/index.md).
