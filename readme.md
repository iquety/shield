## Synopsis

```bash
composer require iquety/shield
```

This library provides a set of Assertions to verify values ​​and expressions.

In computing, an assertion is a verification with the objective of certifying
that a certain condition imposed by the developer is true. If it is true, nothing
happens. If it is false, errors should be used to notify the user.

The use of assertions is very useful, especially in the validation of values
​​coming from method arguments or user input in web applications.

For detailed information, see [Documentation Summary](docs/en/index.md).
