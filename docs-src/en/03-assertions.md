The following assertions are used to validate the value of a variable:

| Assertion  | Description                                                                   |
| :--        | :--                                                                           |
| EqualTo    | Checks if the value of the variable is equal to the expected value            |
| IsEmail    | Checks if the value of the variable is a valid email address                  |
| IsEmpty    | Checks if the value of the variable is empty                                  |
| IsFalse    | Checks if the value of the variable is false                                  |
| IsNotEmpty | Checks if the value of the variable is not empty                              |
| IsNotNull  | Checks if the value of the variable is not null                               |
| IsNull     | Checks if the value of the variable is null                                   |

| MaxLength  | Checks if the value of the variable does not exceed the maximum expected size |
| MinLength  | Checks if the variable value has at least the minimum expected size           |
| NotEqualTo | Checks if the value of the variable is different from the expected value      |

The following assertions will still be implemented:
